# Stephen Grider's Node With React UnOfficial Code Walk Through.

### Reason For This WalkThrough
Stephen Grider's Node With React is GREAT. He goes into great detail how to build a full stack node express application using many different libraries to create a fully functioning full stack application. I loved the course but found myself having to return to hours of videos to find some small part of reference material that I needed. I've created this walk through as an addition to his course free for the world to the use as a companion for whenever you need to reference some part of the project.

### State of the walk through
Becuase I'm going through the entire course again, preparing this walk though, it is not the complete course as of now. New sections will be added about once a week. I have tried to keep the code condensed yet readable. At the end of each major section I have added the complete files and code in markdown that you should have up to that point. I have not added any styles or Materialize to the project giving you a little more freedom in deciding how the project should look. 

### Next steps
After the entire course has been transcribed to just the code sections I will have to go back check for typos and errors. In the meantime feel free to clone or fork this repo. To contribute just open an issue and create a pull request if you can fix the issue.
